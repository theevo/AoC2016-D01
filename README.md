# Advent of Code 2016 Day 1

*A solution by Theo Vora (@theevo)*


## How to Run

1. Clone/Download
2. Open **AoC2016-D01.xcodeproj**
3. ⌘R to run
4. Output appears in the Debug area

*Note*: Simulator will yield a blank screen. This is expected as I did not wire up the results of my solution through IBOutlets. They are written to the Debug console.

## Run Tests

To run XCTests, just press ⌘U.

## About the solution
